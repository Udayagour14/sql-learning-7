# SQL revision day 7
Day 7 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and Filtering Data in MySQL by Subqueries. I have selected data from tables which was created from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days!
## Filtering Data in MySQL Using Subqueries
### Subqueries (also known as inner queries or nested queries) are powerful tools in SQL that allow you to perform operations based on the result of another query.
### Basic Subqueries:
Use subqueries to filter results based on another queryâ€™s result.
Common in WHERE clauses to refine search criteria.
### Correlated Subqueries:
Subqueries that reference columns from the outer query.
Useful for filtering based on related data.
### Subqueries in FROM Clause:
Treat the result of a subquery as a temporary table.
Useful for complex aggregations and transformations.
### Combining Subqueries with JOIN:
Leverage subqueries to enhance filtering criteria in join operations.
